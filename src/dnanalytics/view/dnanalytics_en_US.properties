cnv.title=Call Copy Number Variants
cnv.description=This tool calls Copy Number Variants using a predefined list of exons taken from Ensembl (emsebl.org). The BAM input should be GATK-ed. We recommend to create a folder for the output, because 6 or 7 files will be created. with the output file.
dindel.title=Dindel (Indels call)
combine.description=You can combine your GATK output VCF in three ways. (1st) Intersection: variants which are present in all files. (2nd) Aggregation: variants which are present in any of the files. (3rd) Discordance: variants which are present in the first file, but not in the second. Other files are not taken into account.
filter.description=Filters a SIFT tsv file. Use this tool to crop the variants by frequency. Select a threshold and a column. When you press 'Start' a new file _filtered will be created with the same content except for those lines with a frequency over the threshold in that column.
select.description=Filters a GATK VCF file using a expression. The variants which agree this expression will be filtered out.
align.description=Aligns two FASTQ files with a human reference genome. The FASTQ files can be Illumina or Sanger coding, but only Illumina has been tested. The human reference genome should be selected in Settings section. The datasets are used for recalibrating the output BAM, according to GATK standards.
annotate.description=Use the links below to go to the related webpages.
call.description=Calls SNPs and Indels from a GATK-ed BAM file.
dindel.description=Calls only indels from a BAM file using DINDEL, a heavy and long algorythm. Due to perfomance problems, it is possible that this tool takes about 3 or 4 days per run, so be careful. We reccomend you to open the windows2 folder inside temp folder, and see how files are created. Good luck.
index.description=Index the human genome reference, using three different softwares: bwa, which needs the index for aligning sequences; samtools and Picard, which indexes are used very frequently by other tools.
index.waiting=Select a genome to see if it's already indexed
label.paramerror=Parameters error. Do you miss somthing?
no.indexed=This genome is not indexed.
no.program=Incompatible launch in your system.
recal.presnp=Building SNP recalibration model
recal.applysnp=Applying recalibration to the SNPs set
recal.preindel=Building Indel recalibration model
recal.applyindel=Applying recalibration to the Indels set
recal.title=Recalibrate variants
recal.description=This creates a new VCF file which contains all the original variants from the original VCF file, but now the Indels and SNPs are annotated with their recalibrated quality scores (VQSLOD) and either PASS or FILTER depending on whether or not they are included in the selected tranche.
recal.completed=Recalibration completed succesfully
